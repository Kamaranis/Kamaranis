## About Me! 
I am a Data Scientist with Expertise in Psychology and Technology

As a data scientist with a background in clinical psychology, I bring a unique interdisciplinary perspective to data-driven solutions. My career path began in hospitality, transitioned through the Spanish military and security sectors, and now focuses on healthcare and IT. Over the last five years in Japan, Iâ€™ve enhanced my expertise in patient care, data analysis, and ethical AI development.

I hold dual Master's degrees in Computer Science and Data Science, equipping me with strong technical capabilities and a passion for leveraging big data and machine learning to solve complex problems. I'm particularly driven by the ethical application of AI, ensuring technology benefits humanity responsibly.

### Key Strengths:

- **Data Analysis:** Advanced proficiency in Python, R, SQL, and machine learning algorithms.
- **Problem-Solving:** Experienced in tackling complex challenges across healthcare, security, and technology sectors.
- **Leadership:** Strong leadership skills gained from both military and civilian environments.
- **Communication:** Capable of translating technical insights for diverse audiences.
- **Interdisciplinary Approach:** Integrating psychology, technology, and healthcare for innovative solutions.

### Current Projects:
ðŸ”­ currently working on a mid-term project for Novo Nordisk, a pharmaceutical company, focusing on the ethical implications of artificial intelligence and its application of psychological techniques in crisis situations.  
Specifically, I am collaborating with my team to address mental health emergenciesâ€”such as anxiety, suicidal ideation, and depressionâ€”among employees isolated by snow in Scandinavia. Additionally, I am reviewing how AI applies EMI/EMDR and cognitive-behavioral therapies in these scenarios to ensure ethical and effective intervention.
